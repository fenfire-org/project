<h1>What expectations you have for the course?</h1>

<p>
There's the addvertisement sent to mitopis mailing list:
</p>

<pre>
There is an offer of two credits of experience to a little bit more
strange point of view -- how computer could serve user in better ways
to manage daily tasks. Unique identities, scenes and colors. Does it
work? I challenge you to chase up.

Course's content is formed of the base ideas of the Fenfire research
project during the last five years.

Even if the course is degreed as a laudatur-course, it will fit well
to anyone who has a passed mark from the programming. The best
receiving from the course might be with friends of Linux and free software.
