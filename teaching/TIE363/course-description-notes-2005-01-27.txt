- About Fenfire technologies
- Central idea: "identity" [and relations]
- Course: Lectures about Fenfire technologies; XXX
- How to pass the course:

  - students are free to select a subject related to FF;
  - do something practical, e.g. port part of a program,
    or part the OpenGL code to Win/Mac
  - also mailing list discussions about the lectures,
    which can be substituted by doing exercises
    (writing an essay or piece of code)

    - encourage to mailing list discussion, i.e., you don't feel
      like you're doing an exercise 

    1) We send topics for discussion to the list:
       open questions, points that were raised in the lectures,
       code that would be nice to have
    2) Students participate by mails and/or writing code
    3) If we cannot grade students' understanding
       based on their contributions, we give them 
       questions to answer / a topic for a short essay /
       code to write
    4) goto 1)

  - grade is 50% weekly exercises and 50% practical project
  - the project needs to be done to pass



Why take this course?
=====================

* free software;
* non-traditional computing;
* practical experience [with coding in a free software project];
* and, of course, *because*.

- to get a new POV on the "virtuality" presented by a computer
- to learn Fenfire so that you can use it and contribute to it
