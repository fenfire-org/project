<h1>Introduction to Lobs (Layout Objects)</h1>

<p>
Lobs alias Layout Objects is area in Fenfire project which is <em>work in
progress</em>. We aim to have it <a href "../one-idea-is/">ready</a> for
use shortly after this lecture to help you to start your <a
href="../../../conduct/">programming project</a>.
</p>

<p>
The need for yet another layouting system was obivious since:
</p>

<ul>

<li> swing has not free implementation. </li>

<li> awt is not enough. </li>

<li> we were not interested in java2d which many libraries depend on. </li>

<li> we had already choosen to use Java as the programming
language. </li>

<li> none of the above do the proper thing we wanted - system good
looking as latex output, conservative PUI toolkit with animation
support, more flexibility to make changes than vobs provide, and small
memory print. </li>

<li> libvob and thus visual objects are a powerful system with its
coordinate systems and keys but it needs too much care to handle and
for example event handling is not easy - as prooved with FenPDF
prototype. </li>

</ul>

<p>
Therefore Benja started to design and construct layouting system which
used the power of libvob's visual objects but formalized them more
easier and object oriented way. 
</p>

<p>
Those who are too keen to wait to see it in use can check <a
href="http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/darcs/libvob/org/nongnu/libvob/demo/BossBuzzle.java">
an example of boss buzzle </a> (and if you are interested to see how
it differs from a one that uses too powerful visual objects you can
see <a
href="http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/darcs/libvob/vob/demo/lob/boss_buzzle.py">
this example</a> written in jython).
</p>

<p>
The basic idea with Lobs is KISS - do one thing and do it well.  This
idea is from <a
href="http://www.fresco.org/reading.html">InterViews/Fresco</a> which
has been the main inspiration source for Lobs.  These "do one thing
well" objects can be combained to create components, e.g., button
consist of frame, click controller and content lob which may be a
label containing text.
