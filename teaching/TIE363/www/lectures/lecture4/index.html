<p>In the previous lectures, we couldn't yet offer you a version
of Fenfire to play with, because for legal reasons we couldn't publish
the user-level application itself: there is a patent on some of the
visualizations we use. To give you something to play with,
we have written a public version of Fenfire for this lecture,
which does not use the code related to the patent.</p>
<p>This is a very early version and doesn't work great -- we only
threw something together this week... We hope to improve it a lot soon.
In any case, you can use it to navigate an RDF graph already
(there isn't a good interface for changing a graph, yet).</p>
<p>In the following weeks, we would like to program code with you
for an <a class="reference" href="http://fenfire.org/manuscripts/2004/hyperstructure/#an-item-based-user-interface">applitude</a> for Fenfire, i.e., the equivalent of an application
in a normal desktop environment, but integrated with the rest of Fenfire.
The applitude we want to create is a tool for setting up groups
of people, for example a group of students working together
on a course project. ;-) You should be able to</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>list the people in your group</li>
<li>create a mailing list</li>
<li>list ideas and feedback about them</li>
<li>make a schedule for implementing them</li>
<li>publish this information as RDF and allow other people
to download and view it, for example through Fenfire</li>
</ul>
<p>The topic of this lecture will be to create a small view (&quot;viewlet&quot;)
for some RDF data that can be used in Fenfire. We hope that
during the next week you will install the public version of Fenfire
and develop your own similar small view based on it.</p>
