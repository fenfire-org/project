<h1>Introduction to Information Storm - Storm: Storage Module</h1>

<p>
As a response to web's content fast falling apart, problem with
versioning and in general to better management of information has
Tuomas Lukka come up with the idea of Storm, that is information
storage. Short and compact presentation of pros and problems of
current web is described in 
<a
href="http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/darcs/storm/doc/why.rst">
"why"</a> document written by benja or in the short 
<a
href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=900084"> 
article</a>.
</p>

<p>
What is storm and how it uses identities? The first idea is to use
same kind of technology as used in current peer to peer
technologies. A hash is created for a file (with Storm there's no
splitting of the file because it's not designed for sharing big
files). With hash string also content type is used in Storm.

These two forms a identity of the file, that is a Storm <em> block
</em>. An example of the dientity is given here:  
vnd-storm-hash:image/png,pbqrtu42fqpm2zgceea7kzukwiaej5hi.6ikqbro4lk7yf6yrhlw6xutvcpc45u2qodebmzy
</p>

<p>
Additional to file block a owner of the file may be needed, for
example a person or organisation, which has a cryptographic key and
access to electronical signature. For this an <em>owner block </em> is
created which has not to be public but which contains information
which identifies the person or the organisation.
</p>

<p>
For next a Storm pointer is introduced. The meaning of pointer is to
point permamently to information, and thus with them a current web can
be replaced - wouldn't it be too difficult if helsinginsanomat.fi
couldn't refer more than one day paper. A Storm pointer is also storm
block but as a content it has a reference to owner block, public key,
and reference to reference block. Storm pointers point to
information but not to file block itself.
</p>

<p>
Reference block is a small RDF graph which itself is also a Storm
block. In this graph there is - finally - a reference to file block
itself or actually to identity which identities the block, and a
signature of the owner. 
</p>

<p>
The actual work - versioning - is done by above mentioned
components. New version of file, that is a new block identity, is put
into the system by creating a new reference which obsoletes previous
reference blocks.
