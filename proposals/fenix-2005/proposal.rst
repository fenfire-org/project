Abstract
========

- allow the knowledge worker to "make their own application"

XXX


Introduction
============

In today's mainstream computing environments, knowledge workers 

- have to use different, unintegrated applications
- have different, unintegrated taxonomies on their computers (i.e.,
  folder hierarchies on the disk and in several applications)
- have to do the "integration" manually

- Semantic Web technologies promise to allow application integration

- To some degree, projects make use of this; viz. Haystack, WinFS&c

  - WinFS makes programming new applications easier
  - Haystack allows pieces from different applications to be used together

- Fenfire allows the user to do this on a deeper level and *create their own
  "applications"*.


.. --- let me try again ---

- In today's mainstream computing environments, knowledge workers ...
  have to deal with information being scattered across applications ...
  the same person may exist as six different objects in six different
  applications, and additionally appear in countless text documents ...

- The Semantic Web technologies promise to provide a solution to this problem.
  Unlike previous technologies for data representation, such as 
  relational databases, XML, or object-oriented programming, the Semantic Web
  technologies have [a built-in concept of the identity of real-world things,
  such as people; they naturally allow the fact to be expressed that
  the Lisa Mattilainen in Alice's Outlook database is the same entity
  as the Lisa Mattilainen in Bob's Mozilla Thunderbird contact list].

  XXX should mention and ref RDF model above

- The most popular Semantic Web application today, the FOAF (Friend 
  of a Friend) project [ref], makes extensive use of this. FOAF is an
  RDF vocabulary used [XXX explain how and for what]. To refer to a friend
  in their FOAF file, a user will include the friend's e-mail address
  or the address of their homepage. This allows the computer to automatically
  infer that the two people are the same [XXX explain bnodes somehow --
  need to make clear that the two "objects" are "merged"]




Is this relevant?
=================

- computer programs are mostly created with activity centered design
- use one program to do one thing.
- activity centered design is short-term solution to one particular
  problem
- in long run users can not remember the related stuff anymore.
- users' mind doesn't work with hierarchies that current computing
  offers.
- For example, why should users use search engines to find
  documents that are referred by the document they are reading?
- Fenfire has a very simple idea - everything can be connected to
  anything else.
- It's not intended to replace activity based computing but make the
  production with these programs to be easier for user and support
  both long- and short-term operations with computers.
