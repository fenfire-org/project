Past:
=============

2005-02-19:
    - Finally got the mouse events to focused spatial lob
        - Use StructView as THE structure lob :)
        - Buoy events are still hard to fix.
        - The problem is buoy coordinates - I think.

2005-02-16/17: 
    - Sleep and rest.

2005-02-15:
    - siksak moved to a mouse hole.

2005-02-13/16:
    - Tried to change the structure thing to lob system during night and 
      daylight. No success. [3d]

2005-02-12:
    - Read "Programming Environments Based on Structured 
      Editors: The MENTOR Experience" [2h]

    - There was two modes but not clear what they meant with those.
    - p7. """Furthermore we intended this environment to be realistic enough 
      to help in implementing large software developments, and provide a programming
      team with tools for specifying a design, enforcing a programming
      methodology and verifying interfaces."""
    - p14. """One of the most commonly heard criticism of MENTOR is that it should
      be possible to edit programs on yout screen in the same way as for
      instance with EMACS editor. We do not believe that this would be an
      easy task, and we do not even think such a facility is really
      desirable."""
    - p15. """Finally, a major drawback of mixing structured editing and 
      display editing is that the user would have to learn hot to use 
      two command languages instead of one."""
    - p15. """It seems that in the average a PASCAL programmer need 
      about a week to get accusted to this new world of trees."
      ..."Past this period, few return to the standard tools."""
    - p15. """However, it is very important that the user may correspond 
      to the system trough the concrete syntax he is used to: he should be 
      able to visualise his tree with unparsing, and conversely input 
      his program text with parsing."""

2005-02-09:
    - With Benja:
        - Started The Fenfire! [3h]

2005-02-08: 
    - Start journals again.
    - Implement with Benja [5h]
        - unitSq for AWT
            - This was quite a fun since it was buggy 
              and the AWTVobCoorder had some crap from 
              history.
            - Btw. always use non symmetric rectangle 
              to test something! It took quite long to 
              found the bug.
        - between cs
        - translate polar
    - Discussion with Benja about views. [2-3h]
        - I enjoyed after selling my idea to Benja who tried 
          to sell like fury his idea to me :)

2005-02-07:
    - Ported buoy cs from C++ side to AWT. [5h]
