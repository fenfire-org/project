<h1>Introduction to Libvob</h1>

<p>
Libvob stands for a library for visual objects. Behind this, a bit
superficial description, is an idea to be able to create user
interfaces for identities, where visual objects are put to
<em>scene</em>. Another scene which in common is the next scene and
current scene is used to have an animation between these. The
animation is based on keys, so that if visual object is binded to
specific key it is animated to place where the key is in next scene.
</p>


<p>
More artistic presentation of key animation is part of

Every color part of document in the picture express a key. When moving
to next picture (black edges) an animation is performed by reacting to
user input.
