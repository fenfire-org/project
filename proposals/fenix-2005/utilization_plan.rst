Abstract
========

The goal of this project is twofold: First, to create a Semantic Web
browser and editor developers, to further Semantic Web research
and development; and second, to create a tool for knowledge workers
allowing them to store information in structures useful for their work,
rather than in those provided by fixed applications...


Introduction
============

- Over the last few years, the Fenfire project has...


Goals and intended results
==========================

The goal of the proposed project is to complete and release
a first version of Fenfire as an open source project.


The goal of this project is to wrap up basic research done
by the Fenfire project over the last few years, and to
make an open-source product available that can be used
by the general public.

...to create an open-source tool for knowledge workers...
...make available to the general public...

The goals of this project are:

- provide an open-source tool to Semantic Web developers to further
  research and development
- complete basic research on a framework for applitudes
- based on this, create an open-source tool for knowledge workers
  in general
- maintain these tools and build an open-source community around them...


XXX research goals:

- framework for applitudes, i.e. interfaces that independent programmers
  code against, which then allow their software to be used together
  by the user as part of forming applitudes

- UI for creating applitudes

  - how to let the user create structures (vocabs) for new applitudes,
    or extending existing applitudes

  - how to let the user create view settings for specific applitudes
    (creating new app-specific views)

  - how to let the user create a UI for specific applitudes, i.e.,
    let them create controls useful for an app... is this necessary?

  - 'soft programming' -- how to let the user do simple programming-like tasks
    necessary to wire different applitudes together (i.e., magic potion)

XXX didn't we have a list of research topics for this project, somewhere?


we intend to deliver the goals of this research in a form directly
useful to the general public: as open-source software that may be used
without charge



Demand for goals and results
============================

- We have shown Fenfire at various international conferences
  and there has been substantial interest

- many ppl in the sw community have said 'the tools will save us,'
  but the tools are crappy ;-)

- there *is* no editor for rdf structure that's anywhere as fast to use
  as a text editor is for text

- rdf is too often write-only, need general graph-based tool so that
  developers can browse what's there already and make use of it

- knowledge workers need more powerful tools that allow them to
  structure data in their computers to suit the intrinsic structure
  of their work

Potential applications
======================

- use in companies and organizations
- private users

- rdf browser and editor for semantic web research & development

More questions... :-)
=====================

- Which level of developement the project aims to?
  (basic research, prototyping, pilots...)
  And what additional resources are needed for further developement?


basic research on the scope of this project mostly done? or not?

release open source software [try out in real world]

   - The project aims to complete software application which would be
     freely available for users. 
   - There's additional need to build the Fenfire to share information
     between multiple users that can be done approx. in one to two
     years.


- How the results can be utilized -- commercial, social ot scientific?
  How soon?

first semantic web developers -- as soon as we can 
solve the patent issue enough (we believe 3rd quarter 2005)

there seems to be a need for this type of product

for information workers in general, needs more applitude code
and more polishing of user interface -> involvement of open source community

we believe our product can be useful for early adopers this year (?)

- Which are the aims of project parties to utilize the results? Who
  owns IPR of the project, what's the contract?

copyrights will be owned by non-profit association

all software published under GPL, both companies and private users
are free to use without fees

ISVs wishing to develop proprietary software based on the Fenfire framework
will be able to buy a license from the association; income will be used
to fund further research and development (quid-pro-quo model
successfully used by companies like Trolltech and MySQL)

- What are the duties in utilizing for projects parties (further
  study, lisencing, standarding, manufacturing, sales, marketing, etc.)?

- Does the utilizing need support from outside of the project?

need involvement of open source community

given the existing interest in the community and the need for such a product
we believe we will get this involvement



XXX mention patent above (where is the right place?)




-----------------------------------------------------------------------

And another try ...

What are the goals and intended results?
========================================

The ultimate goal of the Fenfire project is to create a desktop environment
for knowledge workers in which 

a) information is structured as relationships between real-world things,
   rather than through artificial concepts like applications and folders;

b) the user can easily extend the available relationships, creating
   their own "applications";

c) information is easily exchanged between different users with support
   for versioning and collaborative work.

The goals of the currently proposed project are

- to complete a first version of a single-user Fenfire system implementing
  points a) and b), above;
- to publish this software as open source, build a community around it
  and evaluate the results of real-world use of the software.

The single-user Fenfire system will also act as a general, extensible
browser and editor for Semantic Web data.

Additionally, ... [we will produce] the following deliverables ...

- (working libvob/lob system)
- (research on magic potion)
- XXX what else


What is the demand for such goals and results?
==============================================

Information management is an important concern in many organizations today.

The need for higher integration between desktop applications is underscored
by the investment of a large company like Microsoft in a technology like
WinFS, which provides a common, extensible data store to be used by
applications running on the next generation of Windows. (While not directly
compatible with RDF, WinFS is based on a very similar data structure.)

Allowing the *user* to arbitrarily extend the data schemas and applications,
and making this a normal part of the user's activity, is an unusual approach.
However, users do this already, only without tool support; a user
creating a list of club members in a word processor is creating 
a data structure, only without tool support. We believe that allowing users
to extend and relate information from different applications will be
an important improvement in information management for knowledge workers.

Additionally, the Semantic Web, still in a research and development phase,
is growing in importance. On the Semantic Web, semantic information
forms a big network of interlinked graphs. Enough early adopters publish
information in Semantic Web formats today for it to be of interest,
but while there are many tools that make use of data in specific schemas,
only few tools allow the user to browse Semantic Web data in general.
Such tools are, however, needed to make use of the core advantage
of the semantic representation of data: the extensibility with new types
of items and relationships.

Fenfire, providing a way to browse any Semantic Web data, can help users
and developers to start taking advantage of the interlinked structured data
already published on the Semantic Web, and show the usefulness of
providing all sorts of data and extensions in semantic graphs. This can
help to show users the usefulness of Semantic Web data already on-line,
provide an incentive to users to put more data on-line (as they can see
an actual use for it), and help researchers in their use of the Semantic Web.

We have demonstrated components of Fenfire at international workshops
and conferences, and there has been substantial interest from members
of the hypertext and Semantic Web communities in our tools.
