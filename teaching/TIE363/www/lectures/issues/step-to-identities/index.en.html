<h1>A Step to Identities</h1>

<p>
What is identity? As speaking of identities you may think of your own
identity. Now we are not speaking of human identity but rather an
identity which is defined and represented in computer. However, human
identity equates with virtual computer identity in many ways. Since -
<em> identity is unique </em>.

</p>

<p>
Unique, matchless identity means that you can not find another yourself
in the world. You can find people who look the same but they are not
you exactly.
</p>

<p>
Above thinking raises questions  like:
</p>
<ul>
<li> what is the agreed form to represent identity in computer? 
</li>
<li> how to avoid collisions to same identity in global?
</li>
<li> we have a web and it uses unique identities already?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's true that current web uses <a
href="http://www.gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rfc/rfc3986.html">URIs</a>,
that is universal resourcen identifier. One has to said that web has
certain weaknesses, for example weak permanence, locality and very
small versioning. Pros are dynamic content and current use.

What would be a better solution for web?`Of course one can always <em>talk</em> 
about better solutions. We will get back to some ideas later.
In short better solutions do not represent a place, like current web
does but the information itself.
</p>

<p>
Alternative choices are very easy to think. You can think whether a
name would be a better solution. Simple antithesis invalidate this
naming proposal since I know another people, other than myself, who
has a name "Matti Katila".
</p>

<p>
Instead of names computer is good in numbers and therefore identity is
better to represent as a one number. We can start from one or zero and
continue with whole numbers but it would need an agreement who can
have the one, who can have the two and so on. It is better to kill two
flies with one attack and come up with a solution which doesn't need
agreement to have addressing in used information space.
</p>

<p>
A system that doesn't use central contract to address identity is 
(cryptographic) hash function. Examples are MD5 and SHA-1 to say
few. As a matter of thing  <a
href="../intro-to-storm/"> Storm</a> of Fenfire technologies is based
on hash function to build a global information storage.
</p>

<p>
The heart of global identities in computing is deep in probability
math and <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BirthdayProblem.html">
birthday problem </a>.  For example if assume that there is 10 billion
people in worl and everyone of them uses 5 billion representation of
identities in computer. The probability that two same people would get
so bad lucky in lottery that in their computers 
<em> different thing </em> 
is represented with <em> same identity </em> is inordinate
small.
