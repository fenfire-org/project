Past:

2005-02-08: 
    - Start journals again.
    - Implement with Benja [5h]
        - unitSq for AWT
            - This was quite a fun since it was buggy 
              and the AWTVobCoorder had some crap from 
              history.
            - Btw. always use non symmetric rectangle 
              to test something! It took quite long to 
              found the bug.
        - between cs
        - translate polar
    - Discussion with Benja about views. [2-3h]
        - I enjoyed after selling my idea to Benja who tried 
          to sell like fury his idea to me :)

2005-02-07:
    - Ported buoy cs from C++ side to AWT. [5h]
