Abstract
========

- allow the knowledge worker to "make their own application"

XXX


Introduction
============

In today's mainstream computing environments, knowledge workers 

- have to use different, unintegrated applications
- have different, unintegrated taxonomies on their computers (i.e.,
  folder hierarchies on the disk and in several applications)
- have to do the "integration" manually

- Semantic Web technologies promise to allow application integration

- To some degree, projects make use of this; viz. Haystack, WinFS&c

  - WinFS makes programming new applications easier
  - Haystack allows pieces from different applications to be used together

- Fenfire allows the user to do this on a deeper level and *create their own
  applications*.



Is this relevant?
=================

- computer programs are mostly created with activity centered design

- use one program to do one thing.

- activity centered design is short-term solution to one particular
  problem

- in long run users can not remember the related stuff anymore.

- users' mind doesn't work with hierarchies that current computing
  offers.

- For example, why should users use search engines to find
  documents that are referred by the document they are reading?

- Fenfire has a very simple idea - everything can be connected to
  anything else.

- It's not intended to replace activity based computing but make the
  production with these programs to be easier for user and support
  both long- and short-term operations with computers.
