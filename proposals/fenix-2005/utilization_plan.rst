--------------------------------------------------------

- What are the goals and intended results?

   - The goal of the project is to publish single user Fenfire
     environment software where user is able to express relations
     between different items. 

- What is the demand for such goals and results?

   - To make computers more humane for users to work with information,
     that is in everyday work.

- What are the potential applications?

   - The Fenfire itself is the application

- Which level of developement the project aims to?
  (basic research, prototyping, pilots...)
  And what additional resources are needed for further developement?

   - The project aims to complete software application which would be
     freely available for users. 
   - There's additional need to build the Fenfire to share information
     between multiple users that can be done approx. in one to two
     years.

- How the results can be utilized -- commercial, social or scientific?
  How soon?

   - The results can be utilized immediately after publishing by
     anyone. Thus the Fenfire can be used in society, business and
     science.

- Which are the aims of project parties to utilize the results? Who
  owns IPR of the project, what's the contract?

   - The Fenfire is published as a free software under the GPL lisence.

- What are the duties in utilizing for projects parties (further
  study, lisencing, standarding, manufacturing, sales, marketing, etc.)?

   - The project will publish the Fenfire software.

- Does the utilizing need support from outside of the project?

   - Not really. 



Introduction
============

- Over the last few years, the Fenfire project has...


Goals and intended results
==========================

The goal of the proposed project is to complete and release
a first version of Fenfire as an open source project.


Demand for goals and results
===========================

- We have shown Fenfire at various international conferences
  and there has been substantial interest

Potential applications
======================

- use in companies and organizations
- private users

- rdf browser and editor for semantic web research & development

More questions... :-)
=====================

- Which level of developement the project aims to?
  (basic research, prototyping, pilots...)
  And what additional resources are needed for further developement?


basic research on the scope of this project mostly done? or not?

release open source software [try out in real world]


- How the results can be utilized -- commercial, social ot scientific?
  How soon?

first semantic web developers -- as soon as we can 
solve the patent issue enough (we believe 3rd quarter 2005)

there seems to be a need for this type of product

for information workers in general, needs more applitude code
and more polishing of user interface -> involvement of open source community

we believe our product can be useful for early adopers this year (?)

- Which are the aims of project parties to utilize the results? Who
  owns IPR of the project, what's the contract?

copyrights will be owned by non-profit association

all software published under GPL, both companies and private users
are free to use without fees

ISVs wishing to develop proprietary software based on the Fenfire framework
will be able to buy a license from the association; income will be used
to fund further research and development (quid-pro-quo model
successfully used by companies like Trolltech and MySQL)

- What are the duties in utilizing for projects parties (further
  study, lisencing, standarding, manufacturing, sales, marketing, etc.)?

- Does the utilizing need support from outside of the project?

need involvement of open source community

given the existing interest in the community and the need for such a product
we believe we will get this involvement



XXX mention patent above (where is the right place?)
