Abstract
========

- allow the knowledge worker to "make their own application"

XXX


Introduction
============

In today's mainstream computing environments, knowledge workers 

- have to use different, unintegrated applications
- have different, unintegrated taxonomies on their computers (i.e.,
  folder hierarchies on the disk and in several applications)
- have to do the "integration" manually

- Semantic Web technologies promise to allow application integration

- To some degree, projects make use of this; viz. Haystack, WinFS&c

  - WinFS makes programming new applications easier
  - Haystack allows pieces from different applications to be used together

- Fenfire allows the user to do this on a deeper level and *create their own
  applications*.
