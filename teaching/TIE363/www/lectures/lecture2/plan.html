<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>Store all of a user's information in a single, structured data store.</em></p>
<p>Think a single database
containing addresses, e-mails, appointments, ideas.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>In this data store, have references to real-world things
(people, projects, ...)</em>, not only references to strings,
numbers, and so on.</p>
<p>This is <a class="reference" href="semantic.html">what the word &quot;semantic&quot; in &quot;Semantic Web&quot; 
refers to</a>. It allows you to look at
&quot;all information I have about Ann Smith,&quot; instead of
separately having to look for &quot;the address of the person
called 'Ann Smith'&quot;, &quot;mails sent by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ann&#64;example.org</span></tt>&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>Many kinds of information are <em>relationships</em> between real-world things:
&quot;Ann Smith is a senior researcher in the nanotechnology research unit
of Jojodyne, Inc.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Don't have a fixed schema of information.</em></p>
<p>Allow arbitrary extensions of the information that can be stored 
about a thing, even by ordinary users.</p>
<p>For example, a salesperson might want to store 
not only a customer's name and telephone number, 
but also the items the customer has bought from them. 
A teacher might want to store the essay subject
each their students has chosen.</p>
