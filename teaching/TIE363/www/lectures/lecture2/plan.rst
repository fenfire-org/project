The Fenfire vision in points

`Back to 2005-03-30 lecture notes. <index.html>`_

- *Store all of a user's information in a single, structured data store.*

  Think a single database
  containing addresses, e-mails, appointments, ideas.
  
- *In this data store, have references to real-world things
  (people, projects, ...)*, not only references to strings,
  numbers, and so on.

  This is `what the word "semantic" in "Semantic Web" 
  refers to <semantic.html>`_. It allows you to look at
  "all information I have about Ann Smith," instead of
  separately having to look for "the address of the person
  called 'Ann Smith'", "mails sent by ``ann@example.org``", etc.

  Many kinds of information are *relationships* between real-world things:
  "Ann Smith is a senior researcher in the nanotechnology research unit
  of Jojodyne, Inc."

- *Don't have a fixed schema of information.* 

  Allow arbitrary extensions of the information that can be stored 
  about a thing, even by ordinary users. 

  For example, a salesperson might want to store 
  not only a customer's name and telephone number, 
  but also the items the customer has bought from them. 
  A teacher might want to store the essay subject
  each their students has chosen.
