<h1>Manner of Performance</h1>

<p>
To pass the course a small software project in course's subject matter
is accomplished. Weekly contemplation make it possible to have a
higher grade.
</p>


<h2>Weekly Contemplation</h2>


<p>
Weekly contemplation is sent to public 
<a href="mailto:tie363-discuss-k2005@korppi.jyu.fi">mailing list</a>
[<a href="https://korppi.jyu.fi/list-archive/tie363-discuss-k2005/ind.html">
archive</a>].  

Contemplation is appropriate for different people and consist
of following methods:

</p>
<ul>
<li>General discussion</li>
<li>Short essay</li> 
<li>Programming practise</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you feel pressure for sending your contemplation to mailing list
and this makes it hard to pass the course, please contact the lecturers.
We recommend filtering "tie363" emails in different folder than INBOX.

There's also short help to set procmail <a
href="./procmail-help/">in here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Everyone is encouraged to participate in discussion, and that way
raise your grade. The ideal situation would be that it will not even
feel like studing but pleasurable sharing of ideas.
</p>


<h3>General Discussion</h3>

<p>
A student participates mailing list discussion, which can 
vary around the given contemplation, a lecture or somehthing else
which some way affects the subject.

You shall write out different points of views and critique is welcome
as well (thank you). Lecturers give feedback according to your mails
and thus everyone has an oppornity to get involved in mailing
list discussion.
</p>

<p>
Mailing list are well-known method for discussion between free software
developers. As an example you may look lkml.
</p>

<h3>Essay</h3>

<p>
A student can contemplate with essays as well. The essay doesn't have
to be long, three to six paragraphs is fine; longer ones are welcome too. 
By the way, your essay may arouse general discussion in mailing list 
and by defending your opinion you can collect bonus points.
</p>

<p>
Writing is a very valuable skill and therefore a student has an
oppornity to participate in weekly contemplation by essays too.
Essay writing is warmly recommended for all. Consider it an opportunity to have a practise
in writing.
</p>

<h3>Programming Practise</h3>

<p>
You can also participate by a programming task of varying weight.
The language of your choice has to be 
<a

(Java is an exception).

You need to remember to document your code, tell how the program works
and add your copyright notice.
