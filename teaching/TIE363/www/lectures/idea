The idea of lecture texts are to have short issues around one 
particular subject. For a lecture the lecturer(s) could then gather 
up issues a, b, c and d for example. These structure pages that 
are used for a lecture should be put in directories named: lecture1, 
lecture2, ..., lectureN.

The period of time that should be used by one issue is from 15 to 
30 minutes.

Thus a writer shall not depend on other texts but there can exist 
hyper links to them.
