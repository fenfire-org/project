<h1>Thesis of One Idea</h1>


<p>
The following thesis has quite strongly took shape during the project:

<em> "one idea is five minutes, implementations is three months
multiplied by pii."</em>

</p>


<p>
In practice we didn't get done all that what we expected for current
lecture (even if there was Easter between this and the previous
lecture or because of that).

This thesis partially answera also to the question for <a
href="../expectations/index.fi.html#when"> project's achievements</a>.
